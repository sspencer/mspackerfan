Dot eating maze game with ghosts.  For copyright reasons, no artwork is included in the repo, but the same 648x1488 png image used was easily found on [https://www.spriters-resource.com/](https://www.spriters-resource.com/).  If one were to find that image and name it `frozen_tundra.png1`, you'd be well on your way to seeing the game as it develops (circa July 2025).  There's also a `font.png` file that I've found, though don't remember where.
