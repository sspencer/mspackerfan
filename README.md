Dot eating maze game with ghosts. For copyright reasons, no artwork is included in the repo, but the same 648x1488 png image used was easily found on [https://www.spriters-resource.com/](https://www.spriters-resource.com/). If one were to find that image and name it `frozen_tundra.png1`, you'd be well on your way to seeing the game as it develops (circa July 2025). There's also a `font.png` file that I've found, though don't remember where.

Ms. Packer Fan is written in Go and Raylib.  Been experimenting lately with Odin and Raylib lately ([jawbreaker](https://github.com/sspencer/jawbreaker/tree/raylib/odin), [stars](https://github.com/sspencer/animation/tree/master/stars) and[snakes](https://github.com/sspencer/animation/tree/master/snakes)), but decided to make the first crack for this game in Go.

To run:

    go mod tidy
    go run .
